	"RoomDescription": "Pale rock walls open up into a cavern here, just large enough for a few men to stand shoulder-to-shoulder. The walls and ceiling are braced with thick wooden pillars... although on closer inspection, the beams are black and rotting. Time has clearly not been kind to the miners' work.[n][n]The rest of the room is full of scattered industrial remnants. A few rusting pickaxes lean against one wall; three minecarts, piled high with equipment and rocky debris, are lined up against the other. This was clearly the miners' staging area - and judging from the pick-marks on the rock, it was widened artificially for just that reason. [n][n]An archway in the back wall leads through to the main mineshaft, while the collapsed lintel at the entrance promises fresher air.",
