  "description": "The top of this labourer's square head just about reaches your shoulders. Given his own broad frame, the net result in that he looks roughly as wide as he is tall. His coarse linen shirt and canvas trousers don't quite fit him – although given his shape, it’s difficult to imagine anything that would. His youth is betrayed by fuzz that could loosely be called facial hair, and his big hands have remarkably delicate fingers. Despite his rough job, he looks like he could play a piano as equally as he could lift a sack of flour.",
